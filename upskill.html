        <h1>Upskill Assignment 5</h1>

        <p>Good day, everyone and a happy Inauguration Day to the Nigerians. <br><br>

        Below are the questions for Task 5, in this task you are expected to try your hands at all these challenges. 
        You are encouraged to ask your mentors 
        and peers questions on how to go about it, but you are not expected to get an outright solution on them. <br><br>

        For Submission, you are expected to put it all in a single Javascript document and before each attempt, 
        please copy and paste the task question. <br><br>

        Then, when you are done, please put a test case for your answers. For example, if you attempt the first 
        question and your function name is farToCel, 
        I am expecting to see stuff like farToCel(200) or any other number along with what would be the answer 
        if it is run, in comments beside it.</p>
